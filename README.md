A command line tool for seeing weather quickly at a zip code.

Uses the great Google Geocoding API, located here:

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/

And the also great forecast.io weather API, located here:

https://developer.forecast.io/

To use this tool, sign up at the forecast.io link, and set your generated API
key in your environment with env key "FORECAST_IO_API_KEY". A better solution
will be coming soon.
